# IDL VSCode Extension

Entry point for the IDL extension for VSCode.

## Notables

- `env.testing.js` is used to set the environment variables before tests (or VSCode for testing) are started.

- After testing, a folder named `coverage` will be created which contains all of the code coverage information from running tests.
